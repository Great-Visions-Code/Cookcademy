# Cookcademy

Welcome to the Cookcademy repository! This project is part of my journey through the iOS Developer Course on Codecademy. Cookcademy is a recipe app that allows users to discover, share, and manage their favorite recipes all in one place. As I progress through the course, this repository will serve as a live demonstration of the skills and concepts I'm learning and applying.

## About the Project

Cookcademy is designed as a hands-on project within a module of the iOS Developer Course offered by Codecademy. The aim is to create a comprehensive and user-friendly recipe application tailored for iOS devices.

## Progress

As I follow along with the course, I will be updating this repository with the latest features and improvements.

## Contributions

While this project is primarily a personal learning journey for me, I'm open to suggestions, feedback, and contributions from fellow learners or seasoned developers. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!
